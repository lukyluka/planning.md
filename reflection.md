Learning about conditionals was challenging at first, especially distinguishing between the types. However, as I studied, 
their logic became clearer, and I began to see how they work in conversation.

I now understand that zero conditionals express general truths and first conditionals refer to real possibilities. I'm proud of my
ability to create complex sentences, which has improved my communication skills and boosted my confidence.
